### Testing task 2 code:

# Carry out dynamic testing on the code below.
# Correct the errors below that you spotted in task 1.

  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card.name #Â there is no name data associated with card; should be card1.value
  else

    total += card.value # this will total up all respective values of the cards i.e. 8 + 4 etc rather than the count of cards
    return "You have a total of" + total # ? does this need to puts rather than return ?
